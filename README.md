# Rain Open Code Compatible License

A permissive software license that allows open and closed-source use with only one requirement ‚Äî **clear attribution** to the original source.

## ‚ú® About This License

The Rain Open Code Compatible License (ROCCL) is designed to give developers maximum freedom while keeping a single, simple rule: give credit where it‚Äôs due.

It is fully **GPL-compatible**, meaning it can be used alongside GPL-licensed projects without conflict. ROCCL allows use, modification, and distribution ‚Äî including in commercial or closed-source applications ‚Äî without requiring you to open your source code.

Unlike restrictive licenses that impose complex conditions, or ultra-permissive licenses that require no acknowledgment, ROCCL strikes a balance by being **open and compatible** while ensuring original creators are credited.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Why I Created This License

Many licenses are either:

- Too restrictive for collaborative or commercial projects, or
- So permissive that original authors receive no recognition.

I created the Rain Open Code Compatible License because I wanted a license that:

- Works seamlessly with **GPL and other open-source licenses**
- Allows **open, closed, and commercial use**
- Does **not** force developers to disclose their source code
- Ensures the original author receives **clear, visible attribution**

In short, ROCCL is for developers who want **freedom, compatibility, and credit**.
